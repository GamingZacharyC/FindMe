# FindMe
FindMe allows you to search for items in nearby inventories by pressing a key. For that you simply need to hover over an item (JEI Compatible) and press "Y" (By default) and cloud particles will spawn in the inventories that have that item.

 

The range can be configured in the config.

This feature is based in the search feature from [Extra Utilites 2](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/extra-utilities).
